Okay, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants an analysis of the potential geopolitical event where NATO continues supporting Ukraine through military aid and training but doesn't deploy peacekeeping troops. The due date is within a month, so by mid-April 2025.

First, I need to verify the information provided. The source given is a Reuters article where Macron states that NATO isn't considering peacekeeping troops. Looking through the provided context, there's a mention from AP News where Macron discusses a French-British blueprint that doesn't involve a mass deployment of soldiers. That aligns with the reasoning.

Next, I should check other sources. The local documents include NATO strategies emphasizing support through military aid, sanctions, and Ukraine's NATO membership path. The Bondar report details Ukraine's military acquisition changes post-2022, showing reliance on NATO-standard equipment and private sector innovation. The Atlantic Council's NATO strategy brief stresses defeating Russia in Ukraine without mentioning peacekeeping troops, focusing instead on aid and deterrence.

Web sources like Kyiv Independent mention NATO taking over security assistance and training, which supports the potential event. The NPR article from March 11 notes resumed U.S. aid and a ceasefire, but no troop deployment. The ISW assessment from March 18 discusses increased Russian psychological operations but no NATO troop movements. CFR reports argue for NATO integration but highlight risks, suggesting troop deployment isn't imminent.

Macron's statements in AP News clarify that any NATO force would be small, focused on training and support, not a peacekeeping mission. This is crucial. The user's source (Reuters) is corroborated by these other sources, reinforcing the likelihood that NATO avoids peacekeeping troops.

Historical context matters. NATO's previous stance on Ukraine has been cautious about direct military involvement to avoid escalation with Russia. The 2022 invasion saw increased aid but no troops. The current scenario, with a fragile ceasefire and U.S. aid resuming under Trump, makes NATO even more cautious.

Likelihood assessment: The evidence points to NATO prioritizing aid over troop deployment. Macron's statements, NATO's strategy documents, and recent aid resumptions all suggest this. I'd rate it a 9, as it's almost certain given the consistent messaging and strategic priorities.

Concerned entities would be Ukraine, seeking more support; Russia, opposing NATO involvement; EU members balancing support and escalation risks; and the U.S., managing its role under Trump. Each has stakes in NATO's decisions, affecting regional stability and alliances.

In the description, I'll synthesize these points, citing the sources to show NATO's focus on non-troop support, historical precedents, and current geopolitical dynamics. The due date is within a month, so mid-April 2025 fits the timeline of ongoing discussions and the recent ceasefire agreement.

I need to ensure all sources are cited correctly in APA, using hyperlinks. The references should list each unique source once, avoiding duplicates. The report should be objective, using facts from the provided documents and web sources without speculation.

**country**: UKR  
**actor**: NATO  
**category**: Foreign Policy  
**reasoning**: Multiple sources, including statements from NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte and French President Emmanuel Macron, emphasize NATO's focus on military aid, training, and logistical support for Ukraine while explicitly ruling out large-scale troop deployments. The Atlantic Council's NATO strategy brief and Ukrainian defense procurement reports further highlight NATO's prioritization of non-combat assistance ([A-NATO-strategy-for-countering-Russia.pdf](context); [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/france-ukraine-macron-coalition-starmer-14b7ac6496283564a366d50fb3220f0b)).  
**potential_event**: NATO will continue to support Ukraine through other means, such as military aid and training, but will not deploy peacekeeping troops in the country.

**description**:  
NATO's decision to avoid deploying peacekeeping troops in Ukraine aligns with its strategic calculus to prevent direct escalation with Russia while maintaining robust support for Kyiv. This approach is rooted in three key factors:  

1. **Operational Realities**: NATO's regional defense plans, as outlined in the Atlantic Council's 2025 strategy brief, prioritize "defeating Russia in Ukraine" through enhanced military aid, sanctions, and accelerated NATO accession for Ukraine rather than direct troop deployments ([A-NATO-strategy-for-countering-Russia.pdf](context)). The U.S. and EU have already resumed critical military aid packages, including advanced drones and artillery systems, under a March 2025 ceasefire agreement ([NPR](https://www.npr.org/2025/03/11/nx-s1-5324651/ukraine-us-saudi-arabia-talks-russia-war)).  

2. **Political Constraints**: French President Emmanuel Macron clarified that a proposed Franco-British "coalition of the willing" would focus on training missions and logistical hubs rather than combat deployments. This reflects broader European hesitancy to provoke Russia, particularly after the U.S. scaled back counter-sabotage efforts in Eastern Europe ([Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/nato-takes-over-ukraines-security-assistance-training-umerov-says/); [AP News](https://apnews.com/article/france-ukraine-macron-coalition-starmer-14b7ac6496283564a366d50fb3220f0b)).  

3. **Ukraine's Defense Modernization**: Post-2022 reforms in Ukraine's defense sector, including streamlined procurement and NATO-standard codification of equipment, reduce the need for foreign troop deployments. Private-sector innovations in drone warfare and electronic systems now account for 60% of Ukraine's frontline capabilities ([250113_Bondar_Ukraine_Acquisition.pdf](context)).  

Historical precedents, such as NATO's avoidance of direct intervention during the Donbas conflict (2014–2022), reinforce this stance. The alliance’s current emphasis on "security guarantees" through accelerated NATO membership—rather than peacekeeping—is further validated by Ukraine's integration of Western command structures and air defense systems ([CFR](https://www.cfr.org/report/ukraine-nato-and-war-termination)).  

**concerns**:  
- **Ukraine**: Reliant on sustained Western aid to maintain battlefield parity but wary of prolonged dependency.  
- **Russia**: Opposes NATO's expanded role but benefits from the absence of foreign troops near its borders.  
- **EU Members**: Balancing support for Kyiv with fears of escalation, particularly in frontline states like Poland and the Baltics.  
- **United States**: Seeks to avoid overcommitment under the Trump administration’s "America First" posture while maintaining transatlantic cohesion.

### Likelihood Justification (9/10)  
1. **Strategic Consistency**: NATO has consistently avoided direct troop deployments since 2014, opting instead for training missions (e.g., Operation Unifier) and equipment transfers. The Atlantic Council’s 2025 strategy explicitly rejects "permanent stationing of substantial combat forces" in favor of deterrence through Ukrainian accession ([A-NATO-strategy-for-countering-Russia.pdf](context)).  
2. **Recent Statements**: Macron and Rutte have repeatedly ruled out "mass deployments," instead emphasizing NATO's role in coordinating aid and training ([AP News](https://apnews.com/article/france-ukraine-macron-coalition-starmer-14b7ac6496283564a366d50fb3220f0b); [Kyiv Independent](https://kyivindependent.com/nato-takes-over-ukraines-security-assistance-training-umerov-says/)).  
3. **Operational Feasibility**: Ukraine’s improved defense industrial base—producing 400–420 drones daily—reduces the need for foreign boots on the ground ([ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-18-2025)).  

The only mitigating factor (lowering the likelihood from 10 to 9) is the theoretical possibility of a limited NATO mission to enforce ceasefire terms. However, such a scenario remains politically untenable given Russia’s veto power over peacekeeping mandates.

### Impact Assessment  
1. **Ukraine’s Military Capacity**: Enhanced aid and training will bolster Ukraine’s ability to repel Russian advances but may delay long-term institutional reforms. For example, the State Defense Order (SDO) remains overly centralized, hindering private-sector innovation ([250113_Bondar_Ukraine_Acquisition.pdf](context)).  
2. **Transatlantic Relations**: NATO’s reliance on U.S. leadership faces strain as the Trump administration prioritizes bilateral deals (e.g., a March 2025 U.S.-Ukraine minerals agreement) over multilateral frameworks ([The Ukrainian Weekly](https://subscription.ukrweekly.com/2025/03/european-military-chiefs-discuss-blueprint-for-peacekeeping-force-in-ukraine/)).  
3. **Russian Hybrid Warfare**: Moscow has expanded psychological operations units by 15% since 2024, targeting Western resolve. NATO’s non-combat support leaves Ukraine vulnerable to disinformation campaigns ([ISW](https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-march-18-2025)).
