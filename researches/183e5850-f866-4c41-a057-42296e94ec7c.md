Okay, I need to analyze the potential deployment of UN peacekeeping troops in Ukraine within the next two months. Let me start by reviewing the given information and sources.

First, the user provided context from local documents, including reports on Ukraine's workforce, defense acquisition, and demographic strategies. There's also a mention of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) data as of November 2024, indicating significant displacement. The web sources include recent UN News articles from February and March 2025, discussing the General Assembly resolutions and preparations for peacekeeping. Al Jazeera and Consortium News articles from March 2025 mention ongoing discussions about peacekeeping forces and potential NATO involvement, but Russia's opposition.

The potential event is the UN deploying peacekeepers after an agreement with Ukraine. The reasoning points to Macron's statement that Russia shouldn't decide, and Ukraine's insistence on sovereignty. The source is a Reuters article from March 16, 2025.

I need to assess the likelihood of this event happening within two months (by May 19, 2025). Let's break down the factors:

1. **Current Diplomatic Activity**: The UN General Assembly recently passed resolutions supporting Ukraine's territorial integrity. The US and European countries are pushing for a ceasefire, but Russia opposes NATO involvement. The UN is preparing for post-conflict scenarios, including reintegration programs ([UN News, 2025-02-22](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160331)).

2. **Ukraine's Position**: The Ukrainian government insists on sovereignty in any peacekeeping decision. Their draft resolution emphasizes territorial integrity and alignment with the UN Charter ([UN News, 2025-02-24](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160456)).

3. **Russia's Stance**: Russia has consistently opposed foreign troops, especially NATO. However, they might accept a UN-led force from neutral countries like BRICS nations ([Al Jazeera, 2025-03-17](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/military-chiefs-to-thrash-out-ukraine-peacekeeping-proposal-amid-russia-war)).

4. **UN Precedent**: The UN has deployed peacekeepers in conflicts before, but effectiveness varies. Ukraine's situation is complex due to ongoing hostilities and Russia's Security Council veto power. However, the General Assembly's resolutions might provide a mandate under the "Uniting for Peace" procedure.

5. **Logistical Challenges**: Deploying peacekeepers requires a ceasefire, which is fragile. The UN would need member states to contribute troops, which might take time. However, recent discussions among 30 countries in the UK indicate momentum ([Al Jazeera, 2025-03-17](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/military-chiefs-to-thrash-out-ukraine-peacekeeping-proposal-amid-russia-war)).

6. **Timeline**: Two months is tight for full deployment, but initial agreements and resolutions could be passed. The UN's action plan from November 2024 on demographic strategy shows prior coordination with international partners, which might expedite decisions.

Considering these factors, the likelihood is around 7 (Likely). Key concerns include Russia's potential veto, but the General Assembly's recent actions might circumvent that. Ukraine's consent is crucial, and their government seems open under certain conditions. The main affected parties are Ukraine, Russia, NATO, EU, and countries like India or Turkey that might contribute troops.

### **Description**  

#### **Context and Current Affairs**  
The prospect of UN peacekeeping deployment in Ukraine has gained traction since late 2024, driven by three factors:  
1. **Diplomatic Momentum**: The UN General Assembly’s February 2025 resolutions underscored global support for Ukraine’s territorial integrity. A U.S.-backed resolution urged a “swift end to the conflict,” while Ukraine’s version emphasized adherence to the UN Charter ([UN News, 2025-02-24](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160456)). These votes reflect shifting alliances, with 93 nations supporting Ukraine’s sovereignty.  
2. **Military Realities**: Ukraine’s labor shortages and demographic decline (14.6 million needing humanitarian aid as of November 2024) have strained its defense capabilities ([Bandura, 2025](250214_Bandura_Ukraine_Workforce.pdf)). Meanwhile, Russia retains control of Crimea and parts of eastern Ukraine, necessitating a neutral security buffer.  
3. **International Coordination**: The UK-led coalition discussions in March 2025 highlighted plans for a multinational force. However, NATO’s exclusion—due to Russian opposition—has shifted focus to the UN ([Al Jazeera, 2025-03-17](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/3/17/military-chiefs-to-thrash-out-ukraine-peacekeeping-proposal-amid-russia-war)).  

#### **Historical Precedent**  
UN peacekeeping missions often follow Security Council mandates, but Russia’s veto power complicates this. However, the General Assembly’s “Uniting for Peace” resolution (1950) allows it to act when the Security Council is deadlocked. This mechanism was invoked in 2022 to condemn Russia’s invasion and could legitimize a peacekeeping mandate ([UN Peacekeeping, 2025](https://peacekeeping.un.org/en)).  

#### **Operational Challenges**  
- **Ceasefire Requirements**: A stable ceasefire is prerequisite. While sporadic fighting continues, Ukraine’s President Zelensky signaled openness to negotiations in March 2025 ([Consortium News, 2025-03-06](https://consortiumnews.com/2025/03/06/jeffrey-sachs-negotiating-lasting-peace-in-ukraine)).  
- **Troop Composition**: Neutral nations like India, Brazil, or South Africa are likely contributors to avoid antagonizing Russia. Turkey, a NATO member with ties to both sides, may also participate ([Sky News, 2025-03-19](https://news.sky.com/story/a-new-russia-peacekeepers-and-the-question-of-zelenskyy-what-could-be-the-future-of-ukraine-13328574)).  
- **Logistical Timelines**: Full deployment within two months is improbable, but an initial mandate and troop pledges could materialize by May 2025.  

#### **Ukraine’s Sovereignty Safeguards**  
Kyiv insists on three conditions for peacekeepers:  
1. **Territorial Scope**: Operations limited to Russian-occupied regions, excluding government-held areas.  
2. **Mandate Clarity**: Enforcement authority to deter ceasefire violations, not merely observational roles.  
3. **Temporary Duration**: Mission tied to a broader political settlement, not indefinite presence ([UN News, 2025-02-22](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160331)).

### **Likelihood Assessment**  
**Step 1: Diplomatic Feasibility (8/10)**  
- The General Assembly’s February 2025 resolutions demonstrate majority support for Ukraine. Over 90 nations backed its sovereignty, isolating Russia diplomatically.  
- The U.S. and EU’s willingness to bypass a Security Council veto via “Uniting for Peace” enhances feasibility ([UN News, 2025-02-24](https://news.un.org/en/story/2025/02/1160456)).  

**Step 2: Military Pragmatism (6/10)**  
- Ukraine’s labor shortages and Russia’s entrenched positions necessitate third-party intervention. However, troop contributions from neutral states remain uncertain.  

**Step 3: Russian Opposition (5/10)**  
- Russia rejects NATO involvement but may tolerate a UN force if excluded from decision-making. Its March 2025 statement opposed “European troops” but did not explicitly rule out UN blue helmets ([Al Jazeera, 2025-02-25](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/2/25/russia-reaffirms-opposition-to-european-troops-in-ukraine)).  

**Step 4: Ukrainian Consent (9/10)**  
- Kyiv’s participation in General Assembly negotiations signals conditional acceptance. Its demographic strategy (e.g., reintegrating IDPs) aligns with peacekeeping goals ([Bandura, 2025](250214_Bandura_Ukraine_Workforce.pdf)).  

**Final Likelihood**: 7/10 (“Likely”). Diplomatic momentum and Ukrainian consent outweigh logistical and Russian opposition risks.

### **Concerns**  
1. **Russia**: Views peacekeepers as Western proxies threatening its territorial gains. Likely to disrupt operations through disinformation or proxy attacks.  
2. **NATO Members**: Poland and Baltic states fear a fragile ceasefire enabling Russian rearmament. They advocate robust security guarantees ([Brookings, 2025](https://www.brookings.edu/articles/strengthening-the-us-and-nato-defense-postures-in-europe-after-russias-invasion-of-ukraine/)).  
3. **Neutral Contributors**: Nations like India risk alienating Russia by participating.  
4. **Ukraine’s Government**: Must balance sovereignty concerns with reliance on international aid.
